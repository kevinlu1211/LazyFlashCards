## What is it?


> When learning a new language, vocabulary is of paramount importance. One of the most efficient ways to learn vocabulary is through repetition and flash cards have been used for a long time as it is a very effective tool. LazyFlashCards is an app that automates the retrieval of the definition and pronunciation of Chinese, and English words so that the user does not have to type in these values themselves making the process of creating flash cards much faster. This is done through scraping the page source of an online dictionary for Chinese, and using the Pearson API for English.
